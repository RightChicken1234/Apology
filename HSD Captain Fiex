Dear Captain Fiex sir,

I am RightChicken as you know.
You have helped me a lot in my journey.

In the starting when I first started as the Mobile Task Force, you taught me a lot about the MTF. You have been my mentor from the start.
You have taught me how to guard checkpoints, how to ask somebody for Clearance and Reason, and a lot of things.

I am sorry for how many times, I have been rude to you. I know I can't reverse time and fix my mistakes, but I have done the least to apologize to you.

You have been commanding the team brightly and you haven't failed a single time in your position.

I wish you the best for you and I am sure that you will be promoted very soon.

Once again, I apologize for my behavior. Thank you sir for your teaching skills.
-RightChicken
