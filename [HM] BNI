Dear BNI sir,

You know me, sir, I am RightChicken.

I want to apologize for my behavior and how rude I was to you.

When I was ISD, I was very rude to you and TA sir. It was in the past but I still want to apologize for the mistakes that I had made, sir.

I know that I was very rude at that point, sir, and this won't be enough but this is the least I can do sir.

This is short, sir but I don't remember other things. I hope that you will be cooperative. 
Again I want to apologize for the actions that I did and I hope that you forgive me, sir. 

Thank you for your time.

-RightChicken
