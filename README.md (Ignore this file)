Dear members of Site Opera,

As you know me, I am Lightning Storm AKA RightChicken AKA Fishing Player.

I wanted to do a Apology as I have realized the Chaos I have caused here.

As you can see, there are a bunch of files above with Site Opera's members name.

I have created a different apology for each member which I know.

I am sorry for creating the chaos in the server as Fishing and Right. I promise everyone that I wouldn't repeat the mistakes. If I do, I will be ready to get banned.

But Please accept my last chance and consider this.
I have also deleted my Fishing account, If you want to contact me, you can message me at lightningstormyt user.

Thank You

-----RightChicken/LightningStorm/Fishing
