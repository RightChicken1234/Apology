Dear PonQ sir,

I know I have been rude to you many times but I hadn't realized until now.

I always thought of you as my friend. I didn't know that you would be hurt, but I forgot that you were my senior.

I have been rude to you sir, the most and I have got the result of my actions. MTF DD Scechy sir also told me about my behavior but I hadn't listened to sir.
But now I have realized how much I had hurt you, sir.

You first started as a Recruit but you became my senior, sir, you know why sir? Because You were excellent in your skills. You were better than me sir, and you deserved your 
position, sir. Sometimes, I became jealous of you, but after the result, I understood why you passed me and became my senior, it was because of your skills sir. Your Mobile
Task Force Skills were benifit to both the Mobile Task Force and the Site for having you, sir. You did a perfect job when you were deployed or not deployed, you were perfect
in both HSD and the MTF. I know that you will never let the Site or your team down,+ sir.

I have realized now, and now I will treat you with uttermost respect sir.

Thank You, sir, for your time.
