Dear PonQ sir,

I know I have been rude to you many times but I hadn't realized until now.

I always thought of you as my friend. I didn't know that you would be hurt, but I forgot that you were my senior.

I have been rude to you sir, the most and I have got the result of my actions. MTF DD Scechy sir also told me about my behavior but I hadn't listened to sir.
But now I have realized how much I had hurt you, sir.

I have realized now, and now I will treat you with uttermost respect sir.

Thank You, sir, for your time.
