Dear Deputy Director sir,

As you know, sir, I am RightChicken.

I have been harsh to this server. I have been rude to many people but I have been the most rude to you, sir.

You have many times tried to warn me about my behavior, but I kept repeating it again and again. You have many times tried to teach me but I kept ignoring you, sir.
You had tried to warn me when I was rude to PonQ sir but because of my foolishness, I kept ignoring you, sir.
But now I have realized my mistakes.

You have been the best mentor in my journey and everyone's journey in the Mobile Task Force. You were the best teacher, are the best teacher, and will be the best teacher
in the Mobile Task Force.

You have been commanding the team perfectly, sir. When the Director sir wasn't able to join, you did the commanding perfectly and made us the best team in the RPs.
I want to thank you for your service and apologize for everything, sir.

I assure you that I will respect all my seniors, sir. I will not let you down, sir. Thank you for your co-operation, sir. 

-RightChicken
